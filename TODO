# initial implementation
1. add listener bot for twitch chat
2. setup commands which can be executed(loop, conditions, etc.)
3. interract with the editor(write stuff in)
4. run tests automatically

# improvements:
0. try to make sure nothing malicious can happen
1. allow selection of problem
2. setup command parsing or even pseudocode parsing
